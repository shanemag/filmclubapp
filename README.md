## FILM CLVB (Work in Progress)

Inspired by a film club entirely existing within a WhatsApp group, the goal of this project is to create a cross-plaform single-page web application that can accomodate the workings of a film, book or 
other style of regular review and discussion club, entirely within the digital space. This enables friends or strangers to enjoy stimulating discussion of unfamilar and classic works of media regardless of location in the world.

The web app will allow users to:
- Create and customize their own club and invite their friends to join
- Set the rules of the club: 
  - How long for all members to review each work
  - Warnings/Expulsion for not submitting reviews
  - How to choose which member to choose the next work
  - Whether a rating must accompany reviews
- Submit reviews and ratings for the chosen work
- Leave comments in the club, under chosen works or under others' or their own reviews
- A stored history of reviews for past works
- View statistics page with average ratings for each work by the club

Future nice to haves:
- Native mobile application
- Integration with media APIs

Film Clvb is also open source and will be a good example of how to integrate:
- Dropwizard (Java: Jersey, Jackson, Hibernate) for server-side microservices API
- PostgreSQL
- ReactJS for single page front-end
